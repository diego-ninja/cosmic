# ðŸ›¸ Overview

Cosmic is, in one hand a PHP framework for building CLI applications, and in the other hand a CLI application for building PHP applications. Using Cosmic you can
generate a fully functional PHP application and start coding right away using the Cosmic framework.

In your commands you can use nice spinners and tables, send os based notifications or develop your own themes to customize the look and feel of your application.

Cosmic uses [Symfony Console](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html) and [Termwind](https://github.com/nunomaduro/termwind) under the hood among other packages.
